# SearchingTheXBoson

**20 years from now...** The year is 2043, and you are an experimental particle physicist working on ATLAS experiment at the high-luminosity LHC. A brilliant theory colleague of yours called Prof. Ragnie X. (who you met in Johannesburg at CHACAL2024!) has just written an incredible paper: she found a theory which can explain dark matter AND resolves the hierarchy problem... just by adding one new boson! (Don’t ask me how she did this, she is the brilliant one, not me!). This “X boson” should have a mass between about 500 and 1000 GeV (her theory cannot predict this accurately), and luckily for you, if it exists it should be observable at the HL-LHC via its decay to photons... so what are you waiting for? Go see if it is there and if her theory is correct!

**Course description:** This is the premise of your coding project, for which we have around 3hrs. You will work in python with simulated datasets to design an analysis which would be sensitive to the existence of this claimed “X boson”. Later this afternoon, you will apply this analysis to a new dataset of “HL-LHC” data, and your objective will be to determine if the “X boson” exists (with which confidence, and what mass and cross-section)... or not (in which case you will set an upper limit)! In this last part, each group will be assumed to live in parallel universes: for each of you, the existence or not of this boson, and its mass and cross-section, will be different and randomly-chosen.

**Course outcomes:** By the end of this challenge you should have developed the following skills:
- Know how to manipulate large datasets with tools such as `pandas Dataframes`;
- Know how to visualise and compare distributions for different populations,
eg with `matplotlib`;
- Know how to use a `jupyter notebook` to analyse data;
- Know how to apply selections to datasets in order to maxmise the signal-to-background ratio;
- Know how to parametrise a distribution using a functional form, and so extract a backgroubd estimate;
- Know how to test a hypothesis using the CLs method and measure observables relating to a signal;
